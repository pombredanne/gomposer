# gomposer

A port of [composer/composer](https://github.com/composer/composer) (dependency management for PHP) in [Go](http://golang.org/).

## Motivation

* Learn a new programing language
* Learn multi-core programming / parallel programming
* Learn internals of composer

## Limitations

### Ported version

As a base we used [Composer in version 1.0.0-alpha9](https://github.com/composer/composer/tree/1.0.0-alpha9).

### Ported features

We do not want to port every feature in a different language.
Currently this is a simple PoC and no feature was implemented yet.
If we get something working we will know you :)
